# Instructor guide: registering a lab file's ROM contents

One rule, for every lab file that contains a ROM: register the ROM's
official contents next to the file's official tests, and the tool treats
them as one more test. A student's ROM must hold exactly those words.

---

## 1. What students see

| Where | Effect |
|---|---|
| Layer 1 | Nothing is ever loaded into a ROM. An empty ROM keeps its warning, which says the lab registers the ROM's contents and the debugger refuses to run until the ROM matches. |
| Layer 3 Mode A | Before anything else, every file in the tree (the uploaded file and its subcircuits) whose filename has registered contents is checked word for word. Any empty, different or missing ROM: the board shows one fixed message naming the file and the ROM, how many words differ and the first differing address, and stops. No model call, no daily use consumed. All ROMs match: the analysis runs, the model is told the words are official, and any Data change it proposes on a ROM is stripped. |
| Everywhere | The registered words never appear in the UI, the Settings page, `list_tests()`, the Mode A message, or the model payload. |

The comparison ignores formatting: bare or upper-case hex, Digital's
`n*word` shorthand and trailing zero words all read the same. A student
ROM is read with its own `intFormat` attribute and compared as numbers.
The ROM checked is the one marked *Program Memory*; if none is marked,
every ROM in the file must hold the registered words.

A file with official tests but no registered ROM contents is not
checked; Mode A then treats its ROM like any other component.

The registered contents go with the built-in test. Once a student's own
version of that test is in force (rewritten in Settings where the default
is marked editable, or adopted from Mode B), the file's ROM is no longer
checked: their rows may describe another program.

## 2. Where the configuration lives

One JSON file, shipped with the tool:

```
data/official_tests_defaults.json
```

One entry per lab **filename** (matching is by exact filename, e.g.
`cpu.dig`):

```json
{
  "romlab.dig": {
    "content": "A D\n0 5\n1 6",
    "sha1": "<normalized fingerprint of content>",
    "runtime": "<base64 blob holding the ROM words>"
  }
}
```

- `content` — the official testcase rows (Digital test format: first
  line is the signal header, then value rows). Injected into a run-scoped
  copy whenever a student file's own testcase is missing or modified.
- `sha1` — fingerprint used to recognize an unmodified official
  testcase inside a student file.
- `runtime` — the ROM contents. Present for every file that has a ROM.

The `runtime` key can only be configured here, in the shipped defaults
file.

## 3. Register a lab

1. Open your instructor copy of each lab file in Digital and make sure it
   holds the official testcase and the ROM filled with the official words
   (check *Program Memory* on the ROM if the file has several).
2. Generate and merge the entries in one command:

       uv run python -m dlc.fingerprint cpu.dig control-unit.dig cpu_new.dig controlunit.dig --with-rom --merge data/official_tests_defaults.json

   Each file gets `content`, `sha1` and, when it has a ROM, `runtime`.
   Existing entries are updated in place and everything else in the file
   is kept. A file without a testcase or with an empty ROM is skipped
   with a message.
3. Restart the server.

By hand instead: `content` is the testcase text, `sha1` comes from
`dlc.l3.manifest.normalized_test_hash(content)`, and `runtime` is
`base64(json.dumps({"rom": "<words>"}))` where `<words>` is the ROM's
`Data` attribute as Digital stores it (comma-separated, address 0 first,
bare hex, `7*1f` shorthand allowed). Base64 is obfuscation, not
encryption; keep answer `.dig` files out of the repository.

## 4. Verify

1. Upload a student-style file with the right filename and an empty ROM.
   Layer 1 must show the ROM warning with the registration note.
2. Open Layer 3 and click Analyze: the board must answer "ROM check: ROM
   is empty" and the daily-use counter must not move.
3. Re-upload with the words typed in and one word changed: the board
   names the first differing address. With the exact words the analysis
   runs.

## 5. Quick reference

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| The one file to edit | `data/official_tests_defaults.json` (entry per lab filename: `content`, `sha1`, `runtime`) |
| Generate entries | `python -m dlc.fingerprint <files> --with-rom --merge data/official_tests_defaults.json` |
| The check itself | `dlc/testing/inject.check_rom_contents` (Mode A gate) |
| Everything else instructors can change | the README's *Where to change what* table |
